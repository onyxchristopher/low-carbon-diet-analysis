    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory data analysis will use nutrition, climate, and food composition data to explore food patterns. All three of these fields have constant data - that is, aside from occasional advancements in food production, the underlying facts that the data tries to represent do not change. Despite this, the data involved is still very much in development, perhaps because the fields involved are so complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to explore an intersection of datasets that contain constant information, yet are evolving as well. For this reason, interchangeability of data will be an important focus. Ideally, a similar analysis could be conducted in future using better data and with minimal change to the code. The main question motivating this analysis is the following: Can data be used to derive a nutritionally complete diet with extremely low climate impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nutrition\n",
    "\n",
    "Foods contain a wide variety of nutrients, many of which are essential for human health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people are aware of the most common nutrients, like carbohydrates, protein, fat, calcium, iron, and some vitamins. However, they may be unaware that several more obscure vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients - that is, humans require them to function properly and cannot produce them ourselves. There is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for each essential nutrient, which meets the daily needs of the vast majority of people [1]. Essentially, an excellent diet allows you to meet the RDA for all nutrients every day (or 7x the RDA every week).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different foods have vastly different nutrient profiles: lentils are high in protein and carbohydrates, while walnuts are high in fat. As such, eating a variety of foods is necessary to meet the RDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tolerable upper intake level (UL) is another metric which defines a daily upper bound for a nutrient. Consuming amounts of that nutrient above the UL every day may result in adverse effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carbon\n",
    "\n",
    "All foods need to be produced in some way. This production results in side effects to the environment, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use change, water use, and biodiversity loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are one of the main concerns of climate change due to the catastrophic warming effect they have on the planet's atmosphere. Many greenhouse gases exist, and some are worse for the planet than others. In climate data, carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) are used to measure how much various GHGs warm up the atmosphere. Essentially, CO2eq measure how much CO2 would produce the same warming effect in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "To arrive at the consumer, foods also need to be packaged, transported, and sold. The global food system is so large and complex that it accounts for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions [2]. But again, different foods have vastly different carbon emissions. A kilogram of potatoes requires 0.5 kg CO2eq to be produced, whereas a kilogram of cheese requires 24 kg CO2eq.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common objection to categorizing foods by climate impact is that local foods are far better than internationally shipped foods in terms of emissions. However, this is not exactly true - the transport emissions of foods generally account for only a small portion of their emissions, while production plays a much larger role [2]. As such, data involving the carbon impact of various foods is reasonably accurate regardless of production location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding the catastrophic consequences of unchecked climate change is unquestionably important. Food is an often-overlooked but massive contributor to carbon emissions, deforestation, ocean dead zones... we have to consume food, but how can we minimize our impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where nutrition and climate data becomes important. We know which foods are best in terms of having a low climate impact, but can said foods even be ordered into a nutritionally complete diet? If they can, we have another step we can take to mitigate climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate data on the impact of specific foods appears to be rather new, so it is unlikely an analysis of this type has been performed before. While the scope of this analysis will not be massive, further analyses could use the lessons learned to improve the data processing involved and advance this field of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to provide a base of code that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process the raw datasets into a workable format (a single table)\n",
    "- Use the tabular data to generate a nutritionally complete diet with minimal carbon emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional to the core motivation above, the different aspects of the data processing pipeline will also be considered. A special emphasis will be placed on the code being reusable, due to the high rate of evolution of nutritional, food, and climate data, so that a similar analysis could be performed in future with better data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the core datasets which this analysis uses are quite large, the data that will be practically in use is comparatively much smaller. Food composition and carbon data is extensive, but an unfortunate lack of standardization of naming conventions means that combining these two datasets requires a certain amount of manual verification. For a project of this magnitude, it is therefore not viable to use the larger datasets in full, since the manual work required would exponentiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since much of the code will be reusable, the larger datasets could be combined in future, possibly by tanking the manual verification process or acquiring the name-standardized data that does not yet seem to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, nutrition and climate data have large variances, due to the natural inexactitude of food production. The final data is usually composed of averages. This is true for nutrient RDAs as well, since people have different requirements. As such, any conclusions reached in this analysis are unlikely to hold for all people, but should be reasonably accurate for many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, climate impact data relating to food often discusses land use, water use, eutrophication, etc. To keep the scope small enough and the task achievable, only carbon emissions data will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Dataset Acquisition and Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used come from three places:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our World in Data\n",
    "- canada.ca\n",
    "- The United States Department of Agriculture's FoodData Central\n",
    "\n",
    "Our World in Data provides a downloadable CSV listing different foods and their climate effects [2]. It uses data from Poore & Nemecek's 2018 meta-analysis of the environmental effects of the global food system [3], one of the most comprehensive pieces of research relating to food and climate. They also use a 2022 dataset [4] which extended the food/climate data of Poore & Nemecek. The content provided by Our World in Data is licensed under CC BY [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "The government site of Canada, canada.ca, has several pages of tables listing the average requirements, RDAs, and tolerable upper limits for common nutrients. The terms and conditions state, for all materials on the site [6]:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Unless otherwise specified you may reproduce the materials in whole or in part for non-commercial purposes, and in any format, without charge or further permission, provided you do the following:\n",
    "> - exercise due diligence in ensuring the accuracy of the materials reproduced\n",
    "> - indicate both the complete title of the materials reproduced, as well as the author (where available)\n",
    "> - indicate that the reproduction is a copy of the version available at \\[URL where original document is available\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from canada.ca is a partial reproduction of the information accessed at source [1]. The different tables from which the data is retrieved fall under the title Dietary Reference Intakes (no author). The details of the data collection performed are discussed in section 1.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining the options of webscraping and API use for retrieving nutrient requirement data, no clear options presented themselves. Nutritional requirements data is open for public use, but no source examined gave permission to webscrape, had an API, or was downloadable as a machine-readable format. As such, it was decided that the very small dataset was best collected manually. Canada's government site was chosen for their reliability and clear representation of the data. The collected data, titled nutrient-requirements.csv, is present in the ZIP containing this Jupyter Notebook file. It has been double-checked for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "FoodData Central, provided by the USDA, offers several downloadable zip files [7], notable among which is the SR Legacy database, containing comprehensive composition data for many foods. The food composition data in the downloads is complex and much of it is not required in this analysis. Of the many files downloaded from the SR Legacy database, only 3 were needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- food.csv, a table of foods' IDs, types, and names. This was required to map food names to their IDs.\n",
    "- food_nutrient.csv, a table of food and nutrient IDs mapped onto nutrient amounts. This is the food composition data, but does not contain food or nutrient names.\n",
    "- nutrient.csv, a table of nutrients IDs, names, and units. This was required to map nutrient names to their IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only a small subset of the food.csv and food_nutrient.csv files will be needed, they are not included in the ZIP file containing this Jupyter Notebook. Rather, edited versions that contain the relevant information (named food_used.csv and food_nutrient_used.csv) are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The USDA states the following about FoodData Central in their API Guide [8]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> USDA food composition data are in the public domain and they are not copyrighted. No permission is needed for their use. USDA would appreciate it if developers would list FoodData Central as the source of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Other Data within the Research Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Canada and Australia offer food composition datasets of their own, respectively named the Canadian Nutrient File [9] and the Australian Food Composition Database [10]. Both were considered for use to replace the data from the USDA. However, Canada's dataset is harder to work with, older, and also larger due to the presence of a second official language, French. Australia's dataset is smaller, but only offers downloads under CC BY-SA 3.0 AU (an Australian Creative Commons license) which complicates licensing requirements. Additionally, both list the USDA as a source. Since the USDA is a primary source for much of the nutrition data available, it was chosen over other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutrient requirements data is often governmental and so highly reliable. There were other options, but Canada was chosen since their presentation is fairly intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate data on the impact of specific foods is still rather new. The Poore & Nemecek data is the only primary source data that appears to be currently available, with all sources of similar content being a derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Nutrient Requirements Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutrient requirements vary by age and gender. Adults' requirements are usually quite similar, but there are notable exceptions, such as iron requirements. Wherever adult nutrient requirements are different, the higher value has been collected. This higher value is always within the tolerable upper limit of this nutrient for all adults. Similarly, whenever adult upper limits are different, the lower value has been collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this collection process, the nutrient requirement list may not be as accurate as it could be for a given person. However, if the nutrient requirements dataset was modified to meet the needs of a given person (by adjusting calories, protein, iron, etc. needed) the code would still be reusable.\n",

    "## 2 Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to output a viable diet with minimal carbon emissions. To do this, there are several datasets we need. Data linking food to carbon emissions is required to choose foods with low emissions. Food composition data is required to calculate the nutrients provided by these foods. Lastly, nutritional requirements are needed to ascertain whether the nutrients provided by these foods are adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several steps that need to be performed:\n",
    "1. Order food/emissions data so that low-emission foods come first\n",
    "2. Extract food composition data for these foods\n",
    "3. Use an algorithm (explained later) to check different combinations of these foods against nutritional requirements data\n",
    "4. If a viable diet cannot be created, repeat 2 and 3 with one more food added in.\n",

    "But first, we need to get our datasets into a workable format. We'll start with the emissions data.\n",

    "The emissions data contains several metrics, such as land use, water use, and eutrophication, that we do not require for this analysis. We will move the CSV to pandas then manipulate the data into a series containing only food name and carbon emissions per kilogram."

    "### 2.4 The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original research question was 'Can data be used to derive a nutritionally complete diet with extremely low climate impact?' Good progress has been made, and after several processing steps, our master dataframe has 50 foods ordered by low to high carbon emissions, with enough nutritional information to reasonably use the term 'nutritionally complete'.\n",
    "\n",
    "What remains is an algorithm that will output the first list of food weights which is nutritionally complete, while prioritizing the lowest-emissions foods. Depending on the results, this calculation might be altered. It will be highly adaptable - that is, any number of nutrient columns, food rows, and composition data can be used, as well as allowing for interchangeable nutrient RDAs. This is the essence of the consideration of reusability mentioned in section 1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is ascertain the nature of this algorithm. We require a metric for the weight of each food (this would be best represented as a new column index). We also require nutritional RDAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Upper Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Many nutrients have upper limits, beyond which additional quantities of the nutrient should not be consumed. These upper limits are tricky, since a diet perpetually high (at the upper limit) for a nutrient is not ideal either. Choosing an 'upper bound' beyond which the nutrients should not go is an exceptionally subjective decision. This upper bound should, due to the subjectivity involved, be a modifiable value, which is above the RDA but no higher than any nutrient's tolerable upper limit. For the moment, 120% of each nutrient's RDA has been chosen as the upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Nutrients\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait - there is a column in our table which requires special consideration. If we're perpetually off our calorie goal, even slightly, we'll slowly lose or gain weight. We need calories to be exact. As such, calories should be the calibration metric which we use to make sure we eat a reasonable number of foods. (explained more below)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm might succeed with a small number of foods, or require a larger number. The first thing to do is attempt to create a diet with n foods, where n is the total number of foods in the diet. If that fails, n can take values up to the number of foods in our dataset. The process is explained by the image below."

    "## 3 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm was able to output a viable diet with 50 foods. All the nutrients from these foods fell between the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Though the printed form of the diet seems to contain a lot of very small food quantities, keep in mind that the diet can be multiplied to contain the food consumed in a given week or month. Rather than having a micro-buffet of 50 foods in a day, you would eat larger quantities of these foods sporadically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary research question was, \"Can data be used to derive a nutritionally complete diet with extremely low climate impact?\" Overall, the answer is yes, and we have accomplished our main goal of simply proving it can be done. Beyond this, observing just the output of our algorithm, we can derive some key insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only four loops through the algorithm were needed for a diet to be generated. What this means is that every other nutrient 'fell into place'. This likely indicates that most nutrients don't need to be worried about. A good thing too, considering how many of them there are.\n",
    "2. The algorithm prioritized low-calorie, high-vitamin-and-mineral foods, and arrived at a diet containing higher quantities of them very quickly. As such, if this priority were shaped towards high-calorie, high-vitamin-and-mineral foods (or a similar choice of food qualities) it would likely also result in a viable diet. Put simply, many possible diets with these foods exist.\n",
    "3. Our linear iteration limit of 20 * n, or 1000 iterations for 50 foods, was more than sufficient for a diet with these restrictions. Modification of the algorithm and the nutrient requirements CSV to be more stringent might increase the number of iterations required, but the algorithm's iteration limit should remain sufficient for most modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the nutrients used in this analysis are more complex than they seem. Vitamin K, for example, is actually divisible into three sub-forms, Vitamins K1, K2, and K3. Because the nutrient data is most reliable for agglomerations of nutrients, this is the data that was used. While some increasingly obscure nutrients are essential, because of sparse data it is often best to use insight 1 and avoid worrying about every single possible nutrient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The food composition datasets were direct downloads of database information from the USDA. The database used, SR Legacy, was last updated about three years ago and will not be further updated. Newer databases exist which are using more analytical and transparent techniques to produce highly accurate results, but these new databases simply have much less data. As such, the SR Legacy was the best source of food composition data. Right now, it's the best there is, so it had to be used despite the lack of further support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the climate data downloaded did not contain some basic foods, such as rice. This data is comparatively very new, so it is likely going to be evolving, and more comprehensive data can be acquired for future analyses that are similar to this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Findings and Possibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis fundamentally makes clear that it is possible for the carbon emissions of an average person's diet to be minimized. The implications are wide-reaching, considering food causes more than a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Plant foods, especially fruits and vegetables, are likely to be taking up more and more of the average person's diet as health and environmental science advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intersection of nutrition and climate data is new. It has already been mentioned that future analyses could be conducted with more data and better data, but what about other possibilities? Most people who might benefit from the conclusions derived in this analysis are non-programmers. They can read the findings, but not interact with the code in the analysis itself. Though the central core of the algorithm, as well as the display options, would require improvement, having an interactive nutrition/climate tool based around the techniques explored here would be a fantastic project for the future. \n"
