# Creation of Nutritionally Complete Diet with Minimized Carbon Emissions
## About
Exploratory data analysis performed as part of a university project. The analysis uses the USDA FoodData SR Legacy dataset alongside food carbon emission data and nutrient requirement data to algorithmically formulate a nutritionally balanced diet with very low carbon emissions.

The analysis was done in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, and uses the pandas library heavily, with some numpy as well. Both .ipynb (editable notebook format) and .html (viewable in browser) versions are available for download.

## Interesting sections of code

**Section 2.4 (The Algorithm)**  
Explains the constraints of the problem, formulates a novel algorithm to solve the problem, provides an explanatory flowchart, and implements the algorithm in Python code, with comments referring back to the flowchart.

**Section 2.1-2.3 (Processing)**  
Contains heavy processing of raw emissions, food, and nutrient data into an amalgamated form suitable for use in section 2.4.
